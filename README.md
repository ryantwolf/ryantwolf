### About Me
My name is Ryan Wolf, and I recently graduated from UIUC with a BS in Computer Science.
Now, I am a machine learning developer at Advent Health Partners working on a variety of NLP projects.
My broad interests include **machine learning** and **computer vision**, though I do have a soft spot for anything GPU related.
At Illinois, I did neural surface reconstruction research with [Professor Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). My work as a part of that research can be viewed in my pinned repositories. You can also find some CUDA programs that I am proud of [here](https://github.com/ryantwolf/cuda-exercises).
