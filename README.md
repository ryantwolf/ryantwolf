### About Me
My name is Ryan Wolf, and I recently graudated from UIUC with a BS in Computer Science.
My broad interests include **machine learning** and **computer vision**.
At Illinois, I did neural surface reconstruction research with [Professor Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). My work as a part of that research can be viewed in my pinned repositories.
