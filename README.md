### About Me
My name is Ryan Wolf, and I am a deep learning algorithm engineer at NVIDIA working on the NeMo framework.
My broad interests include machine learning and anything GPU related.
I graduated from UIUC with a BS in Computer Science in December 2022.
At Illinois, I did neural surface reconstruction research with [Professor Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). My work as a part of that research can be viewed in my pinned repositories.
